                    As the designer of this project, I will be performing user research and competitive analysis, and creating user flow, wireframes and prototypes.

            <h3>Process</h3>
            <h4>Discovery</h4>
            <p>
              Our initial focus was on conducting a Competitor Analysis to gain insights into the market space and provide context for the problem we're addressing. We analysed three apps similar to PawPals: 11Pets, DogLog, and Clio.                
            </p>
            <p>
              Our research honed in on User Interface elements and User Experience Flows, including Onboarding, task or reminder addition, User Ratings, and feature sets.                
            </p>
            <p>
              Notably, two of the competitors employed bright colours, such as yellow, in their colour schemes. Yellow, associated with joy and friendship, aligns perfectly with the emotional connection people have with their pets. This friendly and emotionally welcoming aspect is crucial for such apps.                
            </p>
            <p>
              However, the feature sets varied among these apps. 11Pets stood out as the most valued due to its comprehensive features. Nonetheless, many of these features went unused, and users found the app "difficult to navigate," although it became easier with familiarity. This insight pointed us toward the importance of creating an intuitive and user-friendly app.

          <h4>Research</h4>
          <p>
            We conducted five informal interviews with friends and pet owners, leading to the creation of two personas based on common user goals and pain points:

          <h4>Ideation</h4>
          <p>
            In the sketching phase, our primary objective was to design an interface that users could intuitively understand, minimising the need for extensive exploration. We drew inspiration from popular mobile calendar apps and traditional paper weekly planners, both of which are familiar to many users.                
          </p>
          <p>
            The task creation process was designed to resemble adding events to a mobile calendar, a pattern widely recognized by users. We aimed for quick and easy editing, minimizing steps required.
